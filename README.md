# Dotnet NASA Open API

A dotnet API to consume NASA's Open APIs. 

## Why dotnet? 

I wanted to see how C#/ASP.NET version of this project compares to an equivalent Java/Spring Boot NASA API consumer I made previously. 
I am very impressed with C#/.NET, the developer experience is fantastic and things are a lot quicker to get up and running. I didn't need to go out of my way
to install a single package as everything was already right there in the Web API template Visual Studio provides. 
When you consider this along with its wider application potential with Blazor / Maui / Games, I would love to make the switch to the C#/.NET ecosystem and have one 
standard langauge that can produce work on the frontend, backend, web, and apps.
